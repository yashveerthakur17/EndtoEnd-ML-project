#about dvc

dvc does version control for the data

1. Untract the data from your github, ie raw.csv
2. dvc init
   dvc add artifact\raw.csv

   this will create a gitignore and raw.csv.dvc that will hold a hash
   wrt to the original file that will change with the changes in the file

   we need to track the .gitingore and the .dvc to track the
   original data changes for changes without actually commiting the whole original file

   everytime dvc add is done the hash changes
