#about dvc

dvc does version control for the data

1. Untract the data from your github, ie raw.csv
2. dvc init
   dvc add artifact\raw.csv

   this will create a gitignore and raw.csv.dvc that will hold a hash
   wrt to the original file that will change with the changes in the file

   we need to track the .gitingore and the .dvc to track the
   original data changes for changes without actually commiting the whole original file

   everytime dvc add is done the hash changes

3. to go back to older versions of data first go to older version of .dvc by using git
    git log
    #get log sequence
    git checkout <log seq>

    #will take back all the commited code inc the .dvc but not
    data because it wasnt commited to begin with

    #use dvc checkout
    dvc checkout

    # this will swap data to the older version

    to get back to current do
    git checkout main
    dvc checkout # to read latest .dvc and do changes in chronological order
